### 1. Description:

Develop API machine learning application and deploy it in the cloud.


### 2. What kind of case we're solving?

Predict Predict the image of a rhinoceros beetle, dung beetle, whisker beetle or tiger beetle using the ResNet50 neural network.
ResNet50 is a CNN that has 50 core layers (convolutional + fully connected). ResNet50 was developed at Microsoft in 2015 to solve the image recognition problem. This Machine Learning model is also trained on more than 1 million images from the ImageNet database.

### 3. Implementation requirements

#### 3.1 Source code must reside in a GitHub repository.
#### 3.2 CI processes must be configured in the GitHub repository.
#### 3.3 CI processes must necessarily include:
#### Running unit tests.
#### Checking code style for PEP8 compliance. 
#### 3.4 Application feature development should be done in separate branches.
#### 3.5 Code Review should be performed when merging a branch into the main repository.
#### 3.6 The application code must conform to PEP8 style and clean code rules. 
#### 3.7 The project may use a pre-trained model. It is not required to train your own model.
#### 3.8 Deployment of the application to a cloud platform must be configured. Recommended cloud platforms:


### 4. Data summary

Format the code style according to PEP 8.
Set up the flake8 linter in GitHub in Continuous Integration on GitHub Actions.
Ensure that the GitHub Actions linker check is performed without errors or warnings.
